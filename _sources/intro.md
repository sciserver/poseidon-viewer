# Welcome to Poseidon Viewer

This is a small documentation for creating visualization tool for your own ocean datasets.
As of now, the visualization tool only supports the LLC4320 dataset, but it will be expanded to all the datasets we host on [sciserver](https://apps.sciserver.org/dashboard/) and beyond.
The backend interpolation used by this tool is powered by the python package [seaduck](https://github.com/MaceKuailv/seaduck).
